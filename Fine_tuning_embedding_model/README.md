# Fine-tuning an embedding model to improve RAG pipeline

Fine-tuning embedding models is essential for improving Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. By customizing embeddings for your domain, you can boost retrieval precision, reduce hallucinations, and deliver more accurate, grounded responses.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Fine-Tune Embedding Models for RAG

Here’s a high-level workflow to guide you:

1. Select your base model (e.g., OpenAI, NVIDIA, Cohere).
2. Collect query-document pairs from your organization’s internal data.
3. Preprocess the data, cleaning and normalizing as needed.
4. Train the model using frameworks like Hugging Face or Amazon SageMaker.
5. Evaluate using retrieval metrics like Recall@10.
6. Deploy and monitor in your production RAG stack.
